# Data-Analytics-using-Python

Two case study projects from CAB330 Web and Data Analytics unit (QUT), using Python for analysis

## Case study 1 - Supervised learning use case

Given student data, predict whether student will fail or pass.

Used Decision Tree, Regression and Neural Networks model and compare the three models for the model with the optimal accuracy and precision.


## Case study 2 - Un-supervised learning use case

Deciding optimal data mining methods (clustering, text mining, association mining and web mining) 
for given problems, and answering them with following data mining model results.

## Outcomes
### Understand and create supervised learning models and optimisation of model accuracy.
- Decision trees
- Regression
- Neural networks

### Understand and create un-supervised learning models.
- Clustering
- Association mining
- Text mining
- Web mining
